# SECthingv2
this bad boy scrapes every/any type of archive from the SEC in raw form, turning anyone into an archivist.

install python 3.12.
then from command line, simply go to the folder containing the script and type:
python3 gamecockv1.py

it will auto install the required modules, and query for which archives to download.
almost everythings broken at the moment after that, but, AI is a very powerful tool on how to understand the filings inside the archives.
explore, poke around in the, and look things up. 
make learning great again :)
